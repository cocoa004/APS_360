Adventure of a lifetime lyrics, as transposed by Cole: 

We are legends, everyday
tThast what she told me
turn your magic on , 
to me she;d say
everythign you want is a dream away


and I fell my heat beating, 
I feel my heart my heartt beneath my skin 
and I feel my heart beating, 
and you make me feel
like I;m alive again ,jfuidfhepadia, 
ALIVE AGAIN 
oh you make me feel, 
like Im alive again,
said I cant go again ,
not in this way, 
Im a drema 
Sky and saint
and we are only
and I feel my heatrt beating
I feelmy heart beneath my skin
and I feel my heart beating 
cuz you make me feel, 
Like im alive again 
hepadya 
hepadya 
ALIVE AGAIN
oh you make me feel like I'm alive again
