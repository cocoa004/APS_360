# APS_360

Team 61's github repo - feel free to take a look around!

Images that were used for training and testing are not included in the repo because it did not make sense to push all the images to the repo, instead, the respective datasets can be found at the following two websites for Alzheimer dataset and MRI dataset respectively:
